# Brainstorm Analysis: Family Chore Tracker

**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Status**: Ready for PRD Development

## Problem Statement
Family needs a tool to help 9-year-old children independently manage their chores without parental intervention, while supporting weekly family reflection conversations focused on character development (craft, independence, and great attitude) rather than mere task completion.

## Analysis Summary
### Original Request
Parents want a simple chore tracker where they can CRUD chores, kids can complete chores with various recurring schedules (daily, weekend, specific days), and weekly review shows completed/incomplete tasks for family discussion and reflection.

### Critical Questions Asked
- How many kids and what ages? (Answered: 9-year-olds)
- What's the real problem - forgetting, fairness, recognition, or proof?
- What does "without intervention" actually mean?
- Will tracking create more arguments than it solves?
- How will self-assessment work with 9-year-olds?
- What happens when kids don't check something in their self-review?

### Evidence Gathered
- Kids are 9 years old - perfect age for independent responsibility
- Goal is self-directed execution without parental reminders
- Focus on intrinsic motivation through reflection conversations
- Key insight: This is character development disguised as chore tracking
- Critical language: "craft, independence, and great attitude"
- Self-review approach puts ownership on children

## Solution Alternatives
### Option 1: Simple Self-Service Dashboard
- **Description**: Clean interface showing "What do I need to do today?" with basic completion tracking
- **User Value**: Independent task visibility without cognitive overload
- **Complexity**: Simple

### Option 2: Character-Focused Tracker
- **Description**: Emphasizes self-assessment of HOW tasks were done (craft, independence, attitude) rather than just completion
- **User Value**: Builds character reflection skills and intrinsic motivation
- **Complexity**: Medium

### âœ… Option 3: Conversation-Driven Review System
- **Description**: Minimal daily tracking with rich weekly reflection interface designed to facilitate parent-child discussions
- **User Value**: Strengthens family communication and character development conversations
- **Complexity**: Simple

## Recommended Solution
**Choice**: Character-Focused Self-Assessment Tracker
**Rationale**: Combines independent daily use for 9-year-olds with character development focus. Self-review approach builds ownership and creates natural conversation starters for weekly family meetings.
**User Impact**: Children develop self-evaluation skills while parents get insight into child's self-perception and character growth areas.

## Requirements Foundation
### Success Criteria
- Children can independently see and track their daily/weekly chores
- Self-assessment interface encourages reflection on "craft, independence, and great attitude"
- Weekly review generates meaningful parent-child conversations
- Reduces need for parental reminders and interventions
- Parents can easily manage (CRUD) chore assignments and schedules

### Constraints & Assumptions
- **Technical**: Must be extremely simple UI for 9-year-old users
- **Business**: Family project - simplicity over features
- **User**: Children will honestly self-assess when framework emphasizes growth over judgment

### Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Basic chore CRUD, flexible scheduling (daily/weekend/specific days), self-assessment completion, weekly review interface
- **Out of Scope**: Gamification, rewards/punishment systems, sibling comparisons, complex reporting, mobile notifications

## Implementation Readiness
### Complexity Assessment
**Overall**: Simple to Medium

### Dependencies
- Rails 8 application framework (already established)
- Simple user authentication (parents vs. children)
- Basic scheduling system for recurring chores

### Risk Factors
- Children may check everything regardless of actual performance
- Self-assessment concept may be too abstract for some 9-year-olds
- Weekly review conversations require parental commitment beyond the app

## Human Review Required
- [ ] **Assumption**: 9-year-olds will engage honestly with self-assessment rather than just checking everything
- [ ] **Evidence**: Approach will actually reduce arguments rather than create "But I DID check that!" conflicts
- [ ] **Scope**: Balance between simplicity and functionality for effective character development

## Next Steps
1. **Review & Validate**: Confirm self-assessment approach aligns with family values and expected child behavior
2. **Create PRD**: Use `/create-prd` with this analysis as input

## PRD Integration Notes
**Command for next step**:
```bash
/create-prd "Feature: Character-Focused Family Chore Tracker - Use brainstorm analysis from 2025-01-22-family-chore-tracker.md"
```

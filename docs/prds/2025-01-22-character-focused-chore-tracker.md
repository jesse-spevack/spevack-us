# PRD: Character-Focused Family Chore Tracker

**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Status**: Development Ready  
**Based on**: Brainstorm Analysis 2025-07-21-family-chore-tracker.md

## 1. Vision & Story

### User Story
Emma's 9-year-old twins constantly forget their chores, creating daily conflicts. "Did you take out the trash?" becomes a battle of denials and arguments. Saturday mornings are tense as parents discover undone tasks, leading to disappointment and frustration for everyone.

With the Character-Focused Chore Tracker, Sunday becomes reflection time. The kids review their week: "I took out the trash with independence, but I could have done dishes with more craft." Emma and her husband guide meaningful conversations about growth, not just completion. The family builds character together.

### Value Proposition  
Transform chore management from compliance checking into character development conversations that build intrinsic motivation and family connection.

### Emotional Hook
Replace "Did you do it?" arguments with "How did you grow?" conversations.

## 2. Problem & Goals

### Problem Statement
Parents of 9-year-old children struggle with chore management that focuses on task completion rather than character development. Current solutions create compliance mindsets and parent-child conflicts, missing opportunities to build independence, craft, and positive attitudes in children.

**Evidence**: Family conflicts over chores reduce communication quality and create negative associations with responsibility.

### Success Metrics
- **Reduced Conflicts**: 80% reduction in daily chore-related arguments within 4 weeks
- **Increased Independence**: Children initiate chore conversations 3+ times per week
- **Character Focus**: Weekly family meetings occur consistently with character discussions
- **Self-Reflection**: Children can articulate one area of growth each week

### Primary Goals
1. Enable 9-year-old children to independently track and self-assess chore completion
2. Facilitate weekly character-focused family reflection conversations  
3. Reduce parental intervention in daily chore management
4. Build intrinsic motivation through self-evaluation rather than external checking

## 3. User Stories & Experience

### Primary User Stories

**As a 9-year-old child, I want to:**
- See what chores I need to do today without asking my parents
- Mark chores as done when I complete them with good attitude
- Reflect on how well I did things during the week
- Talk with my parents about how I can improve

**As a parent, I want to:**  
- Set up chores with different schedules (daily, weekends, specific days)
- Guide weekly reflection conversations with my child
- Reduce daily chore reminders and checking
- Focus on character development, not just task completion

### User Flows

#### Child Daily Flow
1. Open app/webpage on family device
2. Read instruction: "Place a check mark by all items you did with craft, independence, and a great attitude throughout the day"
3. Complete chores in real life
4. Check items as complete when done
5. Continue with day (no further app interaction needed)

#### Child Weekly Review Flow
1. Open weekly review before family meeting
2. Discuss with parents during family meeting

#### Parent Setup Flow
1. Open parent dashboard
2. Create/edit chores with titles and schedules
3. Assign chores to children

### Acceptance Criteria

**Child Interface Must:**
- Load in under 3 seconds on family devices
- Show only today's chores in simple, readable format

**Parent Interface Must:**
- Support CRUD operations for chores and schedules
- Handle recurring schedules (daily, weekend, Monday/Tuesday, etc.)
- Display child's weekly self-assessment for family discussions
- Work on desktop/tablet devices used by family

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Core Features

**F1. Chore Management System**
- Parents can create, edit, and delete chores
- Each chore has: title, description, assigned child, schedule type
- Schedule types: Daily, Weekend (Sat/Sun), Specific Days (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri combinations)
- Chores automatically appear based on schedule and current date

**F2. Child Daily Interface**
- Simple view showing "Place a check mark by all items you did with craft, independence, and a great attitude throughout the day."
- List filtered to show only today's assigned chores for the child
- One-click completion marking with visual feedback
- No login required (family device assumption)

**F3. Weekly review view**
- Shows all chores completed during the week
- Shows all chores missed
- Shows a simple percentage

**F4. Parent Dashboard**
- Loginless parent access (we trust our kids)
- Full chore CRUD functionality with scheduling
- View child's completed daily tasks for the week
- View child's self-assessment responses

### Business Logic

**Scheduling Logic:**
- Daily chores appear every day
- Weekend chores appear Saturday and Sunday
- Specific day chores appear only on designated days
- Chores reset each day at midnight

**User Management:**
- Two user types: Parent and Child (no auth required)
- Family device assumption - no child login needed

### Technical Integration
- Built on existing Rails 8 application framework
- Uses SQLite3 database for development
- Hotwire/Turbo for dynamic interactions without page refreshes
- Tailwind CSS for clean, simple child-friendly interface
- No external API dependencies

### Performance & Security Requirements
- Page load times under 1 seconds on typical family devices
- No sensitive data collection from children

## 5. Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Basic chore CRUD with flexible scheduling
- Simple child interface for daily chore viewing and completion
- Must be a beautifully designed app that shows high craft
- Must be easy to use on an ipad browser

### Out of Scope  
- **Gamification**: No points, badges, or reward systems
- **Notifications**: No email/SMS reminders or alerts
- **Mobile App**: Web-based solution only
- **Multiple Families**: Single-family application
- **Sibling Comparisons**: No competitive elements between children
- **Chore Scheduling Automation**: Parents manually manage chore assignments
- **Photo/Video**: No multimedia chore verification
- **Time Tracking**: No duration recording for chores
- **Advanced Reporting**: Basic weekly summaries only
- **Multiple Children**: How to handle families with different-aged children?

### Future Considerations
- **Multiple Children**: Currently designed for twins, could expand to support more children
- **Progress Visualization**: Simple charts showing character development trends
- **Multi family support**
- **Family level 4 digit code to open the app**

### Dependencies
- Rails 8 application framework (already established)
- Family device with web browser access
- Parent commitment to weekly family meetings

## 6. Success Validation

### Launch Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: All user flows work correctly on target devices
- **Child Usability**: 9-year-old children can complete daily and weekly flows without assistance
- **Parent Efficiency**: Chore setup takes under 10 minutes initially, under 2 minutes for changes
- **Data Integrity**: Weekly assessments accurately capture and store child responses
- **Family Meeting Integration**: Parent view provides sufficient information for character conversations

### Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**
- **Child Interface Complexity**: 9-year-olds may struggle with self-assessment concept
  - *Mitigation*: Simple language testing, visual design iteration
- **Data Loss**: Weekly assessment data could be accidentally deleted
  - *Mitigation*: Data archival system, weekly backups
- **Device Accessibility**: Family device may not always be available to children
  - *Mitigation*: Works on multiple devices, no data sync required

**Business Risks:**
- **Parent Engagement**: Weekly family meetings may not occur consistently
  - *Mitigation*: Application provides clear meeting preparation, but cannot force participation
- **Child Honesty**: Children may check everything regardless of actual performance
  - *Mitigation*: Position as conversation starter, not judgment tool
- **Scope Creep**: Feature requests may complicate simple design
  - *Mitigation*: Strict adherence to character development focus

- **Device Strategy**: Should this work on phones, or desktop/tablet only? - This should work on mobile, desktop and tablet.

## Implementation Notes

**Target Development Time**: 2-3 weeks for MVP  
**Primary Developer Audience**: Junior Rails developers  
**Integration Point**: `/generate-tasks` command ready for task breakdown

### Next Steps
1. Validate character focus language with target families
2. Create task breakdown using `/generate-tasks`
3. Begin with parent dashboard CRUD functionality
4. Iterate on child interface design with 9-year-old testing
